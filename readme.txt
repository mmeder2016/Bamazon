There are 4 files of use to others
  setup.sql             - to setup the databases.
  bamazonCustomer.js    - Customer level interaction
  bamazonManager.js     - Manger level interaction
  bamazonSupervisor.js  - Supervisor level interaction

There are 2 development files I used quite a bit
  queries.sql           - isolated area to run queries
  db.js                 - isloated js file to write js sql queries

    As far as my own personal notes. I finally always thinking in terms of the
 asyncronous nature of javascript. I do not like all the nesting of the 
 inquirer prompt and the sql query nesting, but it is necessary now for me to
 get the homework done. I am learning Promises and I hope to be using them more
 in the future. It isn't just learning the mechanics, it is also hating the
 nesting so much that will push me into incorporating them in my code sooner.

   I am also reading alot about javascript and this week I spent about 2 days
 on sql tutorials and going through my 1999 Oracle homwork assignments and 
 tests. The database in this assignment could have been designed alot better
 to make the queries easier. 

   I want to do a good job on my homework, but I also need to learn these 
 subjects better. When you go on a job interview, knowing all the technical
 matter is about the only thing you can control. I place a high value on being
 technically prepared for an interview. If you ever take a written test at a 
 job interview, you should get a perfect score. As I said, it is one of the
 only things you can control.
